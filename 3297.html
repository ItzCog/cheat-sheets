			<h1>Software Evolution</h1>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Importance</span> Revolution is required to maintain the value of business software systems;
				Majority of the software budget is devoted to changing &amp; evolving existing software
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Evolution and servicing</span>
				Evolution: In operational use, evolving as new requirements are proposed and implemented in the system;
				Servicing: Small tactical changes to keep it operational, no new functionality added;
				Phase-out: Still used but no further changes
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Change identification and evolution processes</span>
				identification: Which component, Impact, Cost; Impact Analysis -> Accept or not; If accept, release planning
				(Fault repair, Environmental adaptation, System enhancement); Change Implementation
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Change implementation</span>
				If changes implementation developer is not original system developer -> program understanding
				(how program is structured, how it delivers functionality, how changes might affect the program);
				If requirements specification and design documents are available, update documents;
				Proposed changes may be prototyped
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Urgent change requests</span>
				may have to be implemented without going through all stages of the SE process
				(If a serious system fault has to be repaired to allow normaloperation to continue /
				If changes to the system's environment have unexpected effects /
				If there are business changes that require a very rapid response)
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Agile methods and evolution</span>
				based on incremental development hence the seamless transition from development to evolution;
				Automated regression testing is particularly valuable;
				Changes may be expressed as additional user stories
			</p>
			<p>
				Handover problems: development team uses Agile but evolution team prefers Plan-based -> needs detailed documentation;
				development team uses Plan-based but evolution team prefers Agile -> starts from scratch developing automated test and refactoring
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Legacy systems</span> older systems that rely on languages and technology
				that are no longer used for new systems development (not limited to software)
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Replacement</span> risky (lack of complete system specification,
				tight integration of system &amp; business processes,
				undocumented business rules, new software development may be late/over budget),
				expensive (inconsistent programming style, use of obsolete programming languages, inadequate documentation,
				structure degradation, hard-to-understand optimizations, data errors/duplication/inconsistency)
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Software maintenance</span> Modifying a program after it has been put into use
				(normally no major changes to system architecture)
				types: Fault repairs, Environmental adaptation, Functionality addition and modification

			<h1>Internet Basics, HTTP</h1>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">What is the Internet</span> Users see it as services and applications:
				Web and e-commerce; Email, texting, instant messenger; Social networking and blogs;
				Music and video download/upload; Voice and video tele-conferencing
			</p>
			<p>
				Networking professionals see it as an infrastructure: Platform on which above services run;
				A huge and complicated network and is growing rapidly
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">
					Internet is a network that accommodates extant services plus new services that will be invented
				</span>
				Only provides the communication service, does not care about the data contents;
				<span class="semibold">
					Internet is designed to accommodate any network technology, allowing each technology to be used where appropriate
				</span>
				Does not restrict or dictate underlying network technologies
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Internet Architecture</span>
				Follows a network of networks approach; Allows arbitrary networks to be included,
				which could also be a network of networks; Uses IP routers to interconnect individual networks
			</p>
			<p>
				Computers attached to the Internet are known as hosts;
				Each host attaches to an access network, which in turn, attaches to a big network;
				To a host, Internet appears to be one giant network
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">What is WWW</span> The World Wide Web is one of the ways information can be shared over the Internet;
				It allows documents to be linked to one another using hypertext links, thus forming a huge “web” of connected information
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Revolution of WWW</span> The first Web was Read-only, static and somewhat mono-directional;
				<span class="semibold">Web 2.0</span> (Since mid-2000s): With reading as well as writing, the web could become bi-directional;
				Represented the move toward a more social, collaborative, interactive and responsive web.
				<span class="semibold">Next Web candidates: </span>
				<span class="semibold">Web3</span> a decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain
				<span class="semibold">Web 3.0</span> Semantic Web, Artificially Intelligence Web
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Core Features</span>
				A URL to uniquely identify a resource on the WWW;
				At two ends, there are two programs interacting by means of the HTTP protocol, which is in the form of client-server communication;
				(The browser program which makes HTTP requests and that can display the HTML it receives; The web server software program that responds to HTTP requests.)
				The HTTP protocol to describe how requests and responses operate;
				HTML and CSS to publish documents;
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">URL</span>
				In order to allow clients to request particular resources from the server, a naming mechanism is required so that the client knows how to ask the server for the file;
				For the web that naming mechanism is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)</span>
				A URI is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource; URL is one type of URI that identifies the resource by its location on the network;
				The other type of URI is the <span class="semibold">URN</span>, which identifies the resource by name or namespace:
				Provides a way of uniquely naming a resource without specifying an access protocol or mechanism, and
				without specifying a particular location
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Client-server communication</span>
				Used by applications to establish communication; One application program acts as a <span class="semibold">server</span>
				(Always starts execution first, usually always online;
				Running on a host machine known by other peers;
				Awaits contact from any peer)
				The other application program becomes a <span class="semibold">client</span>
				(Initiates contact to the server;
				Requests for services and/or info;
				Location is not important)
				Once communication has been established, data can flow in either direction
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Host to host communication</span>
				For hosts to communicate with each other, they need:
				Some method to identify the peer (Server domain name for client-server)
				Some method to locate the peer (Server IP address)
				Some method to deliver messages to the peer (Network path between client and server)
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">End to end communication</span>
				Each communication service is “labelled” by a port number (must be known by all clients);
				By the unique IP address and port number, the network can locate server programs
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Port numbers</span>
				Valid range: 0 to 65535 (16 bits); Well-known ports: 0 to 1023 (only used by system processes & privileged users);
				Registered ports: 1024 to 49151 (available for ordinary user processes & register with IANA (Internet Assigned Number Authority))
				Dynamic and/or Private ports: 49152 to 65535
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">IPv4 addressing</span>
				32-bit identifier, assigned to a network interface of a host/router, divided into two parts:
				Prefix part which identifies physical network (locator), Suffix part which identifies a host on that physical network (identity)
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Protocols</span>
				A protocol is a set of rules that defines how the peers in the communication are interacting;
				A communication protocol defines:
				format of the message, order of the messages sent and received between two ends, actions taken on message transmission
				and receipt

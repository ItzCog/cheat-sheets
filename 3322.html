			<h1>Internet Basics</h1>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">What is the Internet</span> Users see it as services and applications:
				Web and e-commerce; Email, texting, instant messenger; Social networking and blogs;
				Music and video download/upload; Voice and video tele-conferencing
			</p>
			<p>
				Networking professionals see it as an infrastructure: Platform on which above services run;
				A huge and complicated network and is growing rapidly
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">
					Internet is a network that accommodates extant services plus new services that will be invented
				</span>
				Only provides the communication service, does not care about the data contents;
				<span class="semibold">
					Internet is designed to accommodate any network technology, allowing each technology to be used where appropriate
				</span>
				Does not restrict or dictate underlying network technologies
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Internet Architecture</span>
				Follows a network of networks approach; Allows arbitrary networks to be included,
				which could also be a network of networks; Uses IP routers to interconnect individual networks
			</p>
			<p>
				Computers attached to the Internet are known as hosts;
				Each host attaches to an access network, which in turn, attaches to a big network;
				To a host, Internet appears to be one giant network
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">What is WWW</span> The World Wide Web is one of the ways information can be shared over the Internet;
				It allows documents to be linked to one another using hypertext links, thus forming a huge “web” of connected information
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Revolution of WWW</span> The first Web was Read-only, static and somewhat mono-directional;
				<span class="semibold">Web 2.0</span> (Since mid-2000s): With reading as well as writing, the web could become bi-directional;
				Represented the move toward a more social, collaborative, interactive and responsive web.
				<span class="semibold">Next Web candidates: </span>
				<span class="semibold">Web3</span> a decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain
				<span class="semibold">Web 3.0</span> Semantic Web, Artificially Intelligence Web
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Core Features</span>
				A URL to uniquely identify a resource on the WWW;
				At two ends, there are two programs interacting by means of the HTTP protocol, which is in the form of client-server communication;
				(The browser program which makes HTTP requests and that can display the HTML it receives; The web server software program that responds to HTTP requests.)
				The HTTP protocol to describe how requests and responses operate;
				HTML and CSS to publish documents;
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">URL</span>
				In order to allow clients to request particular resources from the server, a naming mechanism is required so that the client knows how to ask the server for the file;
				For the web that naming mechanism is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)</span>
				A URI is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource; URL is one type of URI that identifies the resource by its location on the network;
				The other type of URI is the <span class="semibold">URN</span>, which identifies the resource by name or namespace:
				Provides a way of uniquely naming a resource without specifying an access protocol or mechanism, and
				without specifying a particular location
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Client-server communication</span>
				Used by applications to establish communication; One application program acts as a <span class="semibold">server</span>
				(Always starts execution first, usually always online;
				Running on a host machine known by other peers;
				Awaits contact from any peer)
				The other application program becomes a <span class="semibold">client</span>
				(Initiates contact to the server;
				Requests for services and/or info;
				Location is not important)
				Once communication has been established, data can flow in either direction
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Host to host communication</span>
				For hosts to communicate with each other, they need:
				Some method to identify the peer (Server domain name for client-server)
				Some method to locate the peer (Server IP address)
				Some method to deliver messages to the peer (Network path between client and server)
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">End to end communication</span>
				Each communication service is “labelled” by a port number (must be known by all clients);
				By the unique IP address and port number, the network can locate server programs
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Port numbers</span>
				Valid range: 0 to 65535 (16 bits); Well-known ports: 0 to 1023 (only used by system processes & privileged users);
				Registered ports: 1024 to 49151 (available for ordinary user processes & register with IANA (Internet Assigned Number Authority))
				Dynamic and/or Private ports: 49152 to 65535
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">IPv4 addressing</span>
				32-bit identifier, assigned to a network interface of a host/router, divided into two parts:
				Prefix part which identifies physical network (locator), Suffix part which identifies a host on that physical network (identity)
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Protocols</span>
				A protocol is a set of rules that defines how the peers in the communication are interacting;
				A communication protocol defines:
				format of the message, order of the messages sent and received between two ends, actions taken on message transmission
				and receipt
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">DNS</span> translates human-readable domain names into the binary addresses used by the Internet Protocol;
				Reverse looks up the domain name from an IP address; Looks up the information of the Email server and DNS server of a domain;
				Load distribution: Maps one domain name to a set of IP addresses (e.g. replicated Web servers)(Different users may select different
				machine for requesting services)
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Domain names &amp; levels</span> Domain names are hierarchical; Domain name is a sequence of labels with dots in between
				and it defines a realm of administrative autonomy of Internet hosts; Most specific label is on the left and most significant label is on the right;
				Rightmost label known as a top-level domain (TLD)
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Distributed hierarchical database</span> four levels of DNS servers:
				<span class="semibold">Root Name Servers</span> The highest level which have information on all TLD name servers;
				Publicly known by all local name servers and response DNS queries from local name servers with the correct TLD name
				servers' information; There are 13 root name servers worldwide
				<span class="semibold">TLD Servers</span> Each top-level domain has its own set of name servers that are responsible
				for providing information under its domain subtree; They know the authoritative servers of a particular subdomain
				in its subtree
				<span class="semibold">Authoritative DNS Servers</span> Each organization should have at least one authoritative
				DNS server; These servers provide authoritative answers to all DNS lookup requests for any publicly accessible
				organization computers if they offer publicly accessible hosts
				<span class="semibold">Local (Default) Name Servers</span>
				Each network service provider must provide one or more local DNS server for supporting DNS requests initiated by internal
				client machines; Applications run on internal machines contact the local DNS server to lookup the mappings; If local DNS
				server has the information, returns the answers immediately; otherwise, local server sends the requests to the root name
				server for answers
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">DNS caching</span> Once the name server knows the mapping information, it caches it in the memory;
				Caching improves efficiency and reduces DNS traffic; A cached mapping is removed after some configured time
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h1>HTTP</h1>
			<p>
				HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the WWW;
				It is an application layer protocol that is sent over TCP;
				The protocol specifies format and meaning of messages exchanged between clients and servers;
				Each message has control information and message content presented in plaintext format, but
				it supports transmission of arbitrary binary data;
				Can download or upload data
			</p>
			<p>
				Follows a classical client-server communication model:
				The client (a web browser) first initiates a TCP connection to the Web server;
				After that, it sends a request to the connected Web server;
				Then it waits for the response from the server
			</p>
			<p>
				HTTP/0.9 was called the one-line protocol and only supported the GET request;
				HTTP headers were introduced in HTTP/1.0;
				Added the status code info in the response messages;
				HTTP/1.0 has one major issue: A new TCP connection is opened for each request/response exchange.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">HTTP/1.1</span> is still widely used at the moment;
				It introduced the concept of reusing the TCP connection (aka Persistent Connection) for multiple request/response exchanges;
				It supports pipelining requests, i.e. sending a second request even before the first response is back;
				Adding caching mechanism to reduce data traffic;

				Support content negotiation between the client and server:
				Clients can specify the best suited representation of data for the user, e.g. language, encoding, image format
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				HTTP message types: request, response;
				<span class="semibold">format</span> multi-line plain text; a single start line (request line for requests, 
				status line for responses), a set of headers, a blank line indicating end of header block, an optional
				message body
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Web caching</span> is a technique that stores a copy of a given resource and serves it
				back when being requested in the future; Cache is close to client thus reduces the response time;
				Decreases network traffic to distant servers
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Two kinds of caches</span> Private browser caches &amp; Proxy servers set up by the
				company/organization/network service provider
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Response headers related to caching</span>
				Cache-Control header: Specifies the number of seconds that this resource is considered to be fresh relative to the time of the request;
				Expires: Specifies the date/time after which the response is considered stale
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Validation</span>
				HTTP uses two response headers and a request header to perform validation
				<span class="semibold">Response</span> Etag: an identifier for a specific version of a resource,
				generated by the server whenever the resource is updated;
				Last-Modified header: contains the date and time at which the origin server believes the resource was last modified
				<span class="semibold">Request</span> Normal GET with the If-None-Match header and/or If-Modified-Since header
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Cookies</span> allow Session management/Personalization/Tracking;
				A small piece of data that a server 'sends' to the browser with the Set-Cookie header;
				The browser may store it and send it back with the next request to the same server with the Cookie header
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h1>HTML</h1>
			<p>
				<span class="semibold">Form elements</span>
				form, input, textarea, button, label, datalist, fieldset, legend, select, option, optgroup;
				form method: <span class="semibold">get</span> Ideal for short forms (searching/retrieving data
				from server); Limited of characters in the form data; Data can be seen in the address bar & remains in
				browser history and cache <span class="semibold">post</span> Ideal for long data/binary data/sensitive
				data; Submitted data is not stored in cache, history, or bookmarks
